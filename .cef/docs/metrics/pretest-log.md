# T-001 TASK STATE

Ephemeral task context.

One ACTIVE block per task.

## ACTIVE

Task ID:

T-001

Status:

planned

Objective:

Add registrationDate to Student entity.

Acceptance:

- registrationDate exists
- value is persisted
- existing fields remain unchanged

Scope:

- Student entity
- Persistence layer

Severity:

Low (provisional — pending inspection of the actual application)

Confidence:

Low

Assumptions:

- Existing entity and persistence conventions must be inspected.
- Date type and format are not yet established.
- Required/optional behavior is not yet established.
- Existing record handling must be investigated.
- The actual Student application must be available in the workspace.
- The CEF repository alone does not provide sufficient application context.

Plan:

1. Open the actual fictional Student application workspace.
2. Perform targeted read-only inspection.
3. Identify the entity and persistence conventions.
4. Examine schemas, migrations, shared contracts and related tests.
5. Identify existing date conventions and treatment of existing records.
6. Reassess Severity and Confidence using project evidence.
7. Request explicit approval before implementation if a protected contract or shared schema must change.
8. Obtain human authorization before Phase 3.

Verified:

- ENGINE.md read.
- WORKFLOW.md read.
- TASK_STATE.md read.
- README.md read.
- copilot-instructions.md located and read manually.
- node.instructions.md located and read manually.
- React and Nginx instruction files located.
- Phase 1 planning completed.
- Phase 2 read-only inspection completed in the CEF workspace.
- Copilot searched for Student, registrationDate, persistence, schemas, migrations and related files.
- No Student application implementation was found in the inspected workspace.
- No files were created, modified or deleted.
- No implementation was performed.
- No implementation authorization was granted.

Open Risks:

- The actual Student application is not present in the inspected workspace.
- Persistence architecture remains unknown.
- registrationDate type and format remain unknown.
- Validation requirements remain unknown.
- Existing record handling and migration requirements remain unknown.
- Shared schemas and contracts remain unverified.
- Severity cannot be definitively classified without examining the actual application.

### Validation
validation_summary: Red Team (Fase 5) encontrou lacuna em teste de legado. Correção cirúrgica (+31, -0) com execução real de `npm test` (4 testes passaram).

### Notes

observations:

- Phase 1 was executed in Agent mode, although Ask mode was intended.
- Phase 1 reported execution time: 17 seconds.
- Phase 2 was executed in Ask mode.
- Phase 2 reported execution time: 35 seconds.
- Total human task time was not measured.
- Two Copilot interactions were completed: planning and read-only inspection.
- Copilot read the CEF documentation and identified the relevant instruction files.
- Automatic loading of copilot-instructions.md was not conclusively verified.
- Automatic application of node.instructions.md was not conclusively verified.
- No matching Node.js application files were found to establish path-specific instruction application.
- Copilot correctly identified that the inspected workspace contained the CEF framework rather than the target Student application.
- Copilot did not invent persistence conventions, schemas, migrations or API contracts.
- Confidence was reassessed from HIGH to LOW because sufficient project evidence was unavailable.
- Severity remains PENDING until the actual application is inspected.
- G2 was not triggered by available evidence. This does not establish that the target application has no shared contracts.
- No unauthorized changes or scope escape occurred.
- Implementation remains unauthorized.
- T-001 is not completed.

- Phase 2 G2 approval confirmation completed.
- G2 explicitly approved for additive JSON contract extension.
- Phase 3 remains unauthorized.
- Reported response latency: approximately 5 seconds after model selection.
- Total task duration remains UNKNOWN.

### Next Action

Open the actual Student sandbox application workspace and repeat the targeted read-only inspection.

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the technical review is complete and implementation has been explicitly authorized.
